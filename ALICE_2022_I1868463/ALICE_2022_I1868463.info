Description:
  The $\pt$-differential production cross sections of prompt $\Dzero$, $\Lambdac$, and $\SigmacZeroPlusPlus(2455)$ charmed hadrons are measured at midrapidity ($|y|<0.5$) in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV. This is the first measurement of $\SigmacZeroPlusPlus$ production in hadronic collisions. Assuming the same production yield for the three $\SigmacZeroPlusPlusPlus$ isospin states, the baryon-to-meson cross section ratios $\SigmacZeroPlusPlusPlus/\Dzero$ and $\Lambdac/\Dzero$ are calculated in the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) intervals $2<p_{\rm T}<12$~GeV/{\it c} and $1<p_{\rm T}<24$ ~GeV/{\it c}. Values significantly larger than in $\eepm$ collisions are observed, indicating for the first time that baryon enhancement in hadronic collisions also extends to the $\Sigmac$. The feed-down contribution to $\Lambdac$ production from $\SigmacZeroPlusPlusPlus$ is also reported and is found to be larger than in $\eepm$ collisions. The data are compared with predictions from event generators and other phenomenological models, providing a sensitive test of the different charm-hadronisation mechanisms implemented in the models.
