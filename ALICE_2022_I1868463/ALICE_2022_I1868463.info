Description:
  The $p_\mathrm{T}$-differential production cross sections of prompt ${\rm D^{0}}$, ${\rm \Lambda_{c}^{+}}$, and ${\rm \Sigma_{c}^{0,++}}(2455)$ charmed hadrons are measured at midrapidity ($|y|<0.5$) in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV. This is the first measurement of ${\rm \Sigma_{c}^{0,++}}$ production in hadronic collisions. Assuming the same production yield for the three $\rm \Sigma_{c}^{0,+,++}$ isospin states, the baryon-to-meson cross section ratios $\rm \Sigma_{c}^{0,+,++}/\rm D^{0}$ and $\rm \Lambda_{c}^{+}/\rm D^{0}$ are calculated in the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) intervals $2<p_{\rm T}<12$~GeV/$c$ and $1<p_{\rm T}<24$ ~GeV/$c$. Values significantly larger than in $\rm e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions are observed, indicating for the first time that baryon enhancement in hadronic collisions also extends to the $\mathrm{\Sigma_{c}}$. The feed-down contribution to $\rm \Lambda_{c}^{+}$ production from $\rm \Sigma_{c}^{0,+,++}$ is also reported and is found to be larger than in $\rm e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions. The data are compared with predictions from event generators and other phenomenological models, providing a sensitive test of the different charm-hadronisation mechanisms implemented in the models.
