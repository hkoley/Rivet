Description:
  CERN-LHC. Measurement of the differential production cross sections of  prompt $p_T$ charmed mesons, D$^0$, D$^{+-}$ and D*$^{+-}$ as a function of $p_T$, produced in  proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The data, collected during 2010 with a minimum-bias trigger, have a total integrated  luminosity of 5nb$^{-1}$ and cover the $p_T$ range 1-24 GeV with absolute rapidity < 0.5.
